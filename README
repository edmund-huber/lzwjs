lzwjs

    Self-deflating Javascript, written in Python and Javascript.

Usage:

    python lzwjs.py < [js file] > [packed js file]

Some tests:

     python lzwjs.py < prototype-min.js > test.js
     >> 29756B ..encypt.. 11931 codes, 18961B ..pack.. 25284B
     >> ratio: 0.849711

How it works:

    lzwjs.py accepts ASCII-encodable data on stdin, which it
    compresses using variable-width LZW, then converts to
    ASCII-encodable base64. A script is written to stdout which
    decodes and decompresses the data, then eval()s it.
