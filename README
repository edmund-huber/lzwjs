lzwjs

Self-deflating Javascript, written in Python and Javascript.

Usage:

    python lzwjs.py < [js file] > [packed js file]

How it works:

    lzwjs.py accepts ASCII-encodable data on stdin, which it
    compresses using variable-width LZW, then converts to
    ASCII-encodable base64. A script is written to stdout which
    decodes and decompresses the data, then eval()s it.
